# Nodes

A playground to do some experiments with the HTML5 canvas element. But mostly experimenting particle physics actually...

Trying to get a reusable and pretty accurate set of objects and methods to deal with points, vectors, forces and collisions in an animated two dimensional world. With or without gravity and drag.

May well lead to something interesting at some point in the future...
